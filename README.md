- 👋 Hi, I’m Ankita, a Master's student at IIT Madras working under the guidance of Dr Chester Rebeiro.
- 👀 Currently interests lie in trying to understand how OS, compiler and architecture play together to make programs run, with a focus on what are the points of vulnerabilities that can cause security issues. 
- 💞️ I’m looking forward to any opportunity that helps me gain a better understanding on the above topics
